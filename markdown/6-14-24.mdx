### **Exciting News!**  
- **New Domain for Chat Services:**  
  We’ve acquired [https://atl.chat/](https://atl.chat/) for all chat-related services! Maybe a Matrix homeserver in the future?
  
- **Connection Details:**  
  - **IRC:** `irc.atl.chat` | Port: `6697` (TLS/SSL) | Channel: `#general`  
  - **XMPP:** `atl.chat` | Room: `general@muc.atl.chat`

### **Domain Acquisition:**  
And lastly, we are very happy to announce that we are being gifted the domain [https://allthingslinux.com/](https://allthingslinux.com/) from a veteran Linux user who wasn't using it anymore so there are exciting opportunities ahead there! Transfer is currently in progress so you may see something non related currently.

### **P.S.:**  
We might be opening up our **ATL email service** soon! 😉
