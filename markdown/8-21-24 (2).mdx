### **Introduction**  
We are pleased to announce the first progress update on the IRC/XMPP systems after their initial shutdown due to abuse. Here's a summary of the updates and ongoing discussions.  

---

### **Discussion**  
A ticket has been initiated with system administrators and community members to explore the future of the IRC/XMPP servers.  

Key topics under discussion:  
- The future existence of the IRC/XMPP servers.  
- Recruitment of moderators and administrators.  
- Implementation of automated moderation.  
- Integration of Discord linking.  
- User registration procedures.

### **IRC**  
- **Modernization Challenges:**  
  IRC’s older architecture makes modernization more challenging compared to XMPP.  

- **Current Software:**  
  We currently use **Ergo IRC server software** due to its user-friendly, modern features. However, switching to alternative software is under consideration.  

- **Community Involvement:**  
  An issue was submitted to the **Ergo GitHub repository** to discuss implementing slowmode/filters.  

- **Progress Update (as of Aug 20, 8:00 PM UTC):**  
  A draft plan has been created and is pending approval from senior management.

### **XMPP**  
- **Server Software:**  
  We utilize **Prosody** for its modularity and modern features, making it more manageable than IRC.  

- **Moderation Benefits:**  
  XMPP’s system appears to be easier to moderate and maintain over the long term.

### **Matterbridge**  
Currently used to link IRC, XMPP, and Discord.  
Efforts are being made to enhance the **automod system** to streamline interactions between the platforms.

### **Conclusion**  
Progress has been steady but slow. We will post a new update once significant advancements are made.
